# Group Project Team 16

This project is a simple web application with a Node.js backend and a static frontend.

## Project Structure

- `server.js`: The main Node.js server file. Handles backend logic and serves static files.
- `package.json`: Contains project metadata and dependencies.
- `public/index.html`: The main HTML file for the frontend, located in the `public` directory.

## How to Start the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Open a terminal in the project root directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Server**

   In the same directory, start the server with:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   (The port may vary if configured differently in `server.js`.)

## Notes

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- All static files are served from the `public` directory.
- Modify `public/index.html` to change the frontend.
